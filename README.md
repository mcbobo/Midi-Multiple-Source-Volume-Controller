# Midi-Multiple-Source-Volume-Controller
Controls volume outputs with midi sliders for people who use multiple outputs (best used with Virtual Audio Controls)

 - This is best used with a program like Virtual Audio Controls

 - I use it to have multiple outputs looped to have a separate sub system and my speakers (usb dac and 5.1 sub line).

 - This will use a midi controller to control their volumes separately 

 * NOTE: all values are hardcoded for the moment.
